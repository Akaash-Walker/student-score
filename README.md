# student_score
This is a basic website that allows users to input a student's name and score, which is automatically updated in a SQL database and displayed on the screen. 
It also has a delete functionality, where a student's name can be inputed and flagged for deletion, which is then reflected in the table with the removal of that data entry.
This uses a more basic approach to handling database operations such as with raw SQL commands inside of PHP files to run commands such as adding and removing users.
